# Schwifty

It's time to get schwifty! A React Native app using [rick-and-morty-api](https://rickandmortyapi.com/), and [react-apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) to display info about Rick and Morty.

## Getting started

Make sure you completed the react native's [official getting started instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started#native) (React Native CLI Quickstart tab). Run `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `cd ios && pod install`. To run the app on Android emulator/device, you need to generate a debug key. You can refer to [those](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android) instructions on how to generate it. You will have to adjust `android/app/build.gradle` according to your generated key.
